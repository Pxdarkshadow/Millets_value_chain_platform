# Millets Value Chain Platform

**Millets Value Chain Platform** is a web-based solution designed to streamline and visualise the value chain of millet production — from farmers through processors, value‐addition, distribution, and end-market. It helps stakeholders monitor inputs, production metrics, logistics and market linkages to improve efficiency, transparency and sustainability.
